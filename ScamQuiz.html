Confirm your address: bit.ly/pkg2847' What do you do?",o:["Click the link to update my address quickly","Ignore it completely","Open the Amazon app directly to check for delivery issues"],c:2,e:"✓ Opening the Amazon app directly is correct! Never click links in unexpected texts. Scammers send fake delivery notifications to steal your credentials."},
    {q:"A romantic interest you met online two weeks ago needs $500 for an emergency plane ticket. What's your move?",o:["Send the money—we have a real connection","Offer to buy the ticket directly through the airline","Decline and suggest video chatting first"],c:2,e:"✓ Declining and requesting video chat is right! Romance scammers ALWAYS avoid video calls. Never send money to someone you haven't met in person."},
    {q:"You're job hunting and get hired after one text interview. They send you a check for $3,000 to buy equipment and ask you to wire back $2,500. Red flag or legit?",o:["Seems legit—they're trusting me","Red flag—this is a classic fake check scam","I'll deposit it and wait before sending money back"],c:1,e:"✓ You spotted the fake check scam! The check will bounce in 2-3 weeks, but you'll have wired your real money. You'd owe the bank the full amount."},
    {q:"Your computer shows a pop-up: 'VIRUS DETECTED! Call Microsoft Support: 1-800-555-0123 IMMEDIATELY.' What do you do?",o:["Call the number to get help","Close the browser with Task Manager and run my antivirus","Click the pop-up to see what the virus is"],c:1,e:"✓ Using Task Manager is correct! These pop-ups are scams. Microsoft never makes outbound calls or creates pop-ups with phone numbers."},
    {q:"An Instagram account selling designer handbags at 70% off only accepts Venmo 'friends & family' payments. Should you buy?",o:["Yes—friends & family avoids fees!","No—this payment method removes buyer protection","Yes, but I'll ask them to ship first"],c:1,e:"✓ Refusing due to payment method is smart! 'Friends & family' removes ALL buyer protection. Legitimate sellers accept credit cards or PayPal Goods & Services."},
    {q:"Someone claiming to be your bank's fraud department calls about suspicious charges and asks you to read them the code they just texted. What do you do?",o:["Read them the code—they're from my bank","Hang up and call my bank using the number on my card","Ask them to verify my account details first"],c:1,e:"✓ Hanging up and calling your bank directly is perfect! That 'verification code' is actually a password reset. Banks NEVER ask for codes over the phone."},
    {q:"You get an email that your Netflix payment failed. It has the Netflix logo and says 'Update payment info to avoid suspension.' What's the safest move?",o:["Click the link to update my payment","Open Netflix app or website directly to check","Reply asking if it's legitimate"],c:1,e:"✓ Going directly to Netflix is right! Phishing emails look real with logos and formatting. NEVER click links in unexpected emails."},
    {q:"A caller says they're from the IRS and you owe $5,000. Pay today with gift cards or face arrest. How do you respond?",o:["Panic and buy the gift cards","Hang up immediately—the IRS never operates this way","Ask them to send official documentation"],c:1,e:"✓ Hanging up is correct! The IRS NEVER threatens immediate arrest, demands phone payment, or accepts gift cards. Real IRS issues come via certified mail."},
    {q:"You find an amazing apartment—great location, below market price. The landlord is 'overseas' but will ship keys after you wire first month's rent. Do you?",o:["Wire the money to secure this deal","Refuse to pay until I see the apartment in person","Ask if I can pay half now"],c:1,e:"✓ Refusing to pay without seeing the property is smart! The 'landlord' doesn't own it—they stole photos. NEVER pay for rentals without touring in person."},
    {q:"A crypto investment promises guaranteed 20% monthly returns with an 'AI trading bot.' Your friend made $3,000 last month. Invest?",o:["Yes—my friend is proof it works","Maybe—I'll invest a small amount to test","No—guaranteed returns don't exist, this is a Ponzi scheme"],c:2,e:"✓ Identifying this as a Ponzi scheme is correct! 'Guaranteed' returns are impossible. Your friend's 'profits' are fake numbers until they collapse."},
    {q:"Someone on LinkedIn offers 'work from home': receive packages and reship them elsewhere. They pay $50 per package. Take the job?",o:["Yes—easy money","No—this is reshipping stolen goods, I'd be committing a crime","Ask for more details"],c:1,e:"✓ Recognizing this as criminal is correct! Package reshipping uses you to launder stolen merchandise. YOU face criminal charges when investigated."},
    {q:"An email from 'PaypaI.com' (uppercase i instead of lowercase L) says you have a payment pending. What's the safest response?",o:["Click the link to check the payment","Notice the misspelled domain and delete the email","Reply asking for more information"],c:1,e:"✓ Catching the misspelled domain shows great attention! This is 'typosquatting'—scammers register lookalike domains. Always check URLs character-by-character."}
